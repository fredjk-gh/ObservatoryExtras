# Themes for Observatory Core

I create a theme for each for my commanders; here they are for you to enjoy:

*  Coddiwompler's Blue and Gold
*  Lyra Circini's Purple Slate

## Installing themes

1.  In Observatory Core, open Core Settings.
1.  In the top section of the window there is a Theme droplist with the default Light and Dark themes. Beside that is an Add Theme button.
1.  Click the Add Theme button and open the theme file. It will be added to the list.
1.  Select it from the list. The theme will be immediately applied.

If you find something isn't themed properly, please let me know! Please include a screenshot and let me know what plugin it is (or ensure that information is included in the screenshot).

NOTE:  Certain plugins are not themeable via the built-in themeing, notably:

*   AstroAnalytica
*   BioInsights
*   Evaluator

These plugins use an embedded web component which Observatory Core cannot theme. However, I believe there is some level of themeing available within those plugins directly.
